## Abstract
The aim of this project is to introduce syntax errors into any program of any language, given the program and the grammar as the input. Error generation can prove useful to us for a variety of applications, such as generation of error debugging questions in a learning tool for students, or creation of a repository mappying incorrect to correct programs, which can be used as a dataset to train a neural network to automatically correct syntax errors.

We take the former application and thus create our website, CodeLearn - An online platform where students are provided with debugging questions, attempt to solve them and are given an appropriate score for their submission.

## Requirements
* python3 
* pip

## How to run the code
First, clone the repository to your machine. Once you are in the repository folder, run the following command to start the flask server:

``` python3 grammar_to_ply/app.py ```

Then, open UI/tools/index.html on the browser and proceed to login.
